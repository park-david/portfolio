## Unsolved Problems

None so far.

## Hurdles Overcome

Building this portfolio as a single-page application was harder than I anticipated. Styling, formatting, even adding elements was confusing at first since there aren't any actual "pages". However, once I understood the behavior of the application, I was able to utilize the capabilities of JavaScript to dynamically manage my content.

## Next Steps

- Incorporate a framework such as Bootstrap.
- Improve the overall quality of my site as I become more experienced.
